## Usage

You can view the full help by running `mcsmanager help`.

`mcsmanager CMD [args]`, where `CMD` is any one of:

- `attach|a` : Open the server console
- `backup|b` : Backup all server files into a .tar.gz archive
- `exec|e <args>` : Executes a command in the Minecraft server, e.g. `mcsmanager exec "say Hello there!"`. This can be used for automated messages before server restarts. :)
- `init|i <URL>` : Initialize the setup for a Minecraft server. The tool will download the server jar for you, so you don't have to.
- `start|s` : Start the Minecraft server
- `stop|t`  : Stop the Minecraft server
- `update|u <URL>` OR `<provider> <version>` : Update the jar file for the Minecraft server. Currently, Paper is the only provider supported.
